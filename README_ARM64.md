## Setup 
### BAM Setup
#### Create UDF for Servers object

1. Access to BAM then select **Administration** tab
2. From **Data Management** section choose **Object Types**
3. From **Servers** category choose **Server** object
4. In **Server** object type page, select **New** and create an **User-Defined Field** from Fields table

    ![Server_object_type](images/Server_Object_Type.png?raw=true)

5. Input the required fields for the new **User-Defined Field**

    ![UDF_can_scale_in](images/can_scale_in_udf.png?raw=true)

6. Click **Add** button to finish

7. Repeat step 4-5-6 to create more **User-Defined Fields**

## Setup workflow

1. SSH to the host which has gateway container running and extract **gateway_nfv_plugin.tar.gz** to the gateway workflow directory:

    ```bash
    tar -xzvf gateway_nfv_plugin.tar.gz
    ```

2. Modify `extracted-directory/gateway_nfv_plugin/config/nfv_config.json` and input the corresponding information:

> Note: Remember to set the permissions to external volumes with the **data** and **logs** directories:

```
chmod -R o=rwx <mapped volume>
```

## Build the docker Scheduler Statistic Collection image

Using when you want to change code scheduler and rebuild it or not have **gateway_nfv_scheduler.tar**.

Run this command:
```
cd extracted-directory/gateway_nfv_plugin/
docker build -t gateway_nfv_scheduler .
```

## Setup Scheduler Statistic Collection Container

1. SSH to the host which has gateway container running and move **gateway_nfv_scheduler.tar** to the gateway workflow directory.

2. Create and modify `.secret` and `.secretkey` files with the correct name in `nfv_config.json`. It must be in the same directory.

3. Set the permissions for **logging** and **config** directories. Users are recommended to map them on your host machine in order to modify in the future. You must do it before running the **Scheduler** container.

    ```bash
    chmod -R o=rwx <directory>
    ```

4. Get ip for the container(s)

    Copy and paste the IPAddress of container configured in **docker-compose.yml** to `nfv_config.json` file.

    ![NFV Config](images/nfv_config.png?raw=true)

> Make sure the permissions of directories is allowed before running the scheduler.

## Deploy by Docker Compose Command

1. Make sure to configured all the files with corresponding information before running build all of the containers: 

    ```bash
    cd extracted-directory/gateway_nfv_plugin/
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    > Note: Can run each of service in **docker-compose.yml** by command:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d <name-of-service>
    ```

2. To remove all of containers in docker compose, run command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down --remove-orphans
    ```

## Install 3rd Python libraries for Gateway Container

1. Execute this command to install 3rd Python libraries with correct path of gateway and gateway-nfv-plugin workflow directories:

    ```bash
    ocker exec nfv_gateway pip install -r /bluecat_gateway/workflows/gateway_nfv_plugin/requirements.txt
    ```

2. Access to Gateway UI. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Administration** and **Encrypt Password** action. Input the path `workflows/gateway_nfv_plugin/config/.secret` set in `config.ini` and the password of `user_name` user.

    ![Encrypt Password](images/gateway_encrypt_pwd.png?raw=true)

> Note: Ports of Gateway UI configured in the **docker-compose.yml** above

3. Navigate to **Workflow Permission**. Add permission to access traffic steering workflow.

    ![Workflow Permission](images/workflow_permission_gate_nfv.png?raw=true)

    If the permission for gateway_nfv_plugin disappears, restart the gateway container and check again.

4. Restart the containers:

    ```
    docker restart nfv_gateway
    docker restart nfv_scheduler
    ```

## Generate Encrypted Password

1. Run `extracted-directory/gateway_nfv_plugin/common/process_password.py`:

    ```bash
    python process_password.py
    or
    python3 process_password.py
    ```

2. Input the plaintext password and get the encrypted password.

    ```
    Example:
    Let's type a new password: example
    Your password is encrypted as: ZXhhbXBsZQ==
    Please update your encrypted password in nfv_config.json file
    ```

3. Copy it and save in `config` files.

4. Restart the containers:

    ```
    docker restart nfv_gateway
    ```
